Mass Page Remover makes it easy to remove multiple pages at once.

== Description ==

Mass Page Remover does exactly what the name implies: it makes it very easy to remove as many pages as you want.

The plugin works as an admin panel. The form contains a start page ID and an end page ID as well as an input for specific IDs. 

Please provide feedback on the blog post so that I can improve the plugin further.
